Tampermonkey Adblock Script

# What is this?
This ad-blocker script for Tampermonkey won't trigger an adblock-block / adblock-detector script and so you could use it for pages that are annoying you with "please turn of your adblock" messages. It's just hiding the ads and don't try to intercept the requests or remove the ads at all. So it don't make the websites faster, but it makes them cleaner and easier to read.

This script is not a generic solution and has to be configured for every website it should clean up. I don't provide configs for pages, just use your browser developer-tools to find the elements you want remove or click.

# Credit
I did not create this script originally. This is a popular Github Gist, so I created a repo for this so it can be easily installed. The original GitHub Gist can be found here: https://gist.github.com/DerFichtl/af462414df838ff397603f8bf9db24e3
